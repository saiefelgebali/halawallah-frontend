# Hala Wallah Frontend
This is the repository for the frontend application of the **Hala** project.

Go to [backend](https://github.com/saiefelgebali/halawallah-backend).

## About This Project
Hala is a mentally, emotionally, and physically sustainable platform, designed to connect friends and family, with no ulterior motive. 

I created Hala as an alternative option for those who seek to rid themselves of their addiction to other platforms. 

Excessive use of social media has been proven to cause feelings of depression and anxiety.
This project aims to create a social platform without the features that are known to cause mental health problems. 

This includes features such as
- Likes
- Follower counts
- Excessive Advertisments
- NSFW Content

This project is an EPQ (Extended Project Qualification) entry.
